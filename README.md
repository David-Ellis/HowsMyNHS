<h1>HowsMyNHS</h1>

<p><a href="www.howsmynhs.co.uk">Hows My NHS</a> is a website designed to present publically available NHS performance data for each NHS trust within the UK. Specifically, we aim to highlight the changes in these numbers over the past decade.</p>

<p> Currently, the website provides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of people, each month, who had to wait over four hours at A&E.</li>
  <li>The number of available overnight beds.</li>
  <li>News items relating to specific Trusts as well as the NHS in general.</li>
</ul>

<h2>NHS England Overview</h2>

<p> As shown on the <a href="https://howsmynhs.co.uk/hospitals/england.html">NHS England summary page</a>, last December over <b>500,000</b> more people were made to wait <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than in 2011. This is an increase of over 900%.</p>
<p>Recently, the number has dropped due to a drop in A&E attendance during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
