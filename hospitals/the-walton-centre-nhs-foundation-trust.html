            <!--Minimal Change Hospital + less than 2000 monthy attendance-->

            <p>It looks like things haven't changed much for your hospital! On average only 0 people attend this A&E 
            each month.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, things aren't so great for the rest of England. After nearly a decade of Conservative rule,
            each month over <b>400,000</b> more people are made to wait <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than 
            in 2016.

            <center><img src="../figures/the-walton-centre-nhs-foundation-trust-waiting.svg" alt="A&E waiting data for The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust - Number of people waiting over four hours each month."></center>

            <p>Now, Brexit and an impending trade deal with Trump's US threatens to increase the NHS drug bill from &pound18 billion to as much as <b>&pound45 billion</b> a year while shutting out the nurses, carers and other workers that the health service depends on.</p>

            <p><i>Note: Over the past few months A&E attendance across England has fallen by more than 50% as people choose to stay at home to help reduce the pressure on the NHS 
            during the current pandemic.</i></p>

            <p> The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is one of the lucky 14% of NHS England trusts which, under Conservative leadership, has more beds than in 2010. With an increase of around 28 beds.<p>

            <center><img src="../figures/the-walton-centre-nhs-foundation-trust-beds.svg" alt="Number of available overnight beds for The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust."></center>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, similar things are being seen accross the country. 
            Overall, there are 23626 fewer NHS beds in England than in 2010. 
            That's a decrease of 19%.</p>
            
            <p>Over 47% of NHS trusts have fewer beds,  whereas only around 14%
            of trusts have significantly more. See our <a href = "england.html"> summary page for the whole of England</a>.</p>
