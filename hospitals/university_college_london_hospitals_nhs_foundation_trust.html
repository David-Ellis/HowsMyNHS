            <p>After nearly a decade of Conservative rule, on average, <b>2444</b> more people are being left to wait over 
            four hours at A&E at <b>your</b> hospital than back in 2010.</p>
            <p>And things are bad for the rest of England too. Each month over <b>400,000</b> more people are made to wait
            <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than in 2011.
            <p>Now, Brexit and a trade deal with Trump's US threatens to increase the NHS drug bill from &pound18 billion to as much 
            as <b>&pound45 billion</b> a year while shutting out the nurses, carers and other workers that the health service depends on.</p>

    <p><b style="color:#b30000;">Stay at home:</b> Right now we only ask this. With the outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19)
    the NHS is under more pressure than ever. We <b>need</b> to do everything we can to slow it's
    spead. Follow the official government guidance: 
    <ul>
    <li>Only go outside for food, health reasons or work (but only if you cannot work from home)</li>
    <li>Stay 2 metres (6ft) away from other people</li>
    <li>Wash your hands as soon as you get home</li>
    </ul>
    Many young people experience few to no symptoms at all but can still carry the virus and pass 
    it on to more vulnerable people.
