            <p>After nearly a decade of Conservative rule, on average, <b>545</b> more people are being left to wait over 
            four hours at A&E at <b>your</b> hospital than back in 2010.</p>

            <center><img src="../figures/united_lincolnshire_hospitals_nhs_trust.png" alt="United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust"></center>

            <p>And things are bad for the rest of England too. Each month over <b>400,000</b> more people are made to wait
            <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than in 2011.

            <p>Now, Brexit and an impending trade deal with Trump's US threatens to increase the NHS drug bill from &pound18 billion to as much as <b>&pound45 billion</b> a year while shutting out the nurses, carers and other workers that the health service depends on.</p>

            <p><i>Note: Over the past few months A&E attendance across England has fallen by more than 50% as people choose to stay at home to help reduce the pressure on the NHS 
            during the current pandemic.</i></p>

<div id="beds" class="tabcontent">
            <p>Under Conservative leadership, United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust has around 100 fewer beds than in 2010. That's a 8.9% drop in the number of beds for those who might desperately need them.<p>

            <p>Unfortunatly, similar things are being seen accross the country. Overall, there are 15,500 fewer NHS beds in England than in 2010. That's a decrease of over 10%.</p>
            
            <p>Over 41% of NHS trusts have fewer beds, whereas less than 25% of trusts have more. See our <a href = "england.html"> summary page for the whole of England</a>.</p>

    <p><b style="color:#005EB8;">Prevent the spread:</b> With the outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19)
    the NHS is under more pressure than ever. We <b>need</b> to do everything we can to slow its
    spread. Follow the official government guidance: 
    <ul>
    <li>Stay at home as much as possible</li>
    <li>Work from home if you can</li>
    <li>Limit contact with other people</li>
    <li>Keep your distance from people not in your household (2 metres apart where possible)</li>
    <li>Wash your hands regularly</li>
    
    </ul>
    Many young people experience few to no symptoms at all but can still carry the virus and pass 
    it on to those who are more vulnerable.

    <p><b style="color:#005EB8;">Share the message:</b> Fight for change. Let your friends and family know that the Conservatives 
    are not the party for the NHS. One vote may have little impact, particularly with our broken electoral system. 
    But together we can bring about great change.</p>
