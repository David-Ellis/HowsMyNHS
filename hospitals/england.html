            <p>After nearly a decade of Conservative rule, in December over <b>500,000</b> more people were made to wait
            <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than in 2011. That's an increase of over <b>900%</b>.
            The number of people attending A&E, however, had only increased by less than 30%.<p>

            <p>Since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, there are 23,600 fewer NHS beds in England.

<div id="covid" class="tabcontent"><p>
        Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 40,200 reported deaths related to Covid-19 in English hospitals.
        There were 58 deaths recorded yesterday and 1,600 over the last seven days. <span style="color:#999999;">Last updated: 29/11/2020</span>.
        </p><center><img src="../figures/england-covid.svg" alt="Number of Covid-19 related deaths for England."></center>
    <p>Please note that these figures, particularly the most recent ones, are subject to change as new reports are made. Additionally, these figures do not include deaths outside hospital, such as those in care homes. For additional information, please see the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-daily-deaths/">official NHS page</a> for Covid-19 death statistics.
    </p>
    
<p>
Undoubtedly, Government failures have meant that more people have died from Covid-19 than they otherwise would have. From toying with the idea of 'herd immunity' instead of initiating an early lockdown to the failure to provide adequate PPE to frontline staff and an ineffective privately run track-and-trace system, the Governments response to the pandemic has been sadly inadequate.
</p>

<p>Additionally, after a decade of underfunding and neglect, the NHS was ill-prepared for a pandemic of this scale. With A&E waiting times at an all-time high, and the number of overnight beds at an all-time low. </p>

<p>The NHS deserves better, we deserve better and we must unite in demanding better.</p>
