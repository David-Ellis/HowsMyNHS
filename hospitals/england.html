            <p>After nearly a decade of Conservative rule, in December over <b>500,000</b> more people were made to wait
            <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than in 2011. That's an increase of over <b>900%</b>.
            The number of people attending A&E, however, had only increased by less than 30%.<p>

            <p><i>Note: Over the past few months A&E attendance across England has fallen by more than 50% as people choose to stay at home to help reduce the pressure on the NHS 
            during the current pandemic.</i></p>

            <p>Since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, there are 26,000 fewer NHS beds in England. 
            That's 26,000 fewer beds for those that who might need them. That's a decrease of over 20%. <p>

            <p> Roughly 50% of NHS trusts have fewer beds, whereas only around 10%
