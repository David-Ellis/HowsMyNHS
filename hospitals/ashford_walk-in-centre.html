            <p> The data show's that thing's have gotten worse in your hospital. With 1791 more people each month 
             being forced to wait over 4 hours to be seen at A&E since 2017. It many English hospitals, the situation is much
             worse. </p> 
             <p>After nearly a decade of Conservative rule, each month over <b>400,000</b> more people are made 
             to wait <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than in 2011.</p>
             
            <p>Now, Brexit and a trade deal with Trump's US threatens to increase the NHS drug bill from &pound18 billion to as much

    <p><b style="color:#b30000;">Stay at home:</b> Right now we only ask this. With the outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19)
    the NHS is under more pressure than ever. We <b>need</b> to do everything we can to slow its
    spread. Follow the official government guidance: 
    <ul>
    <li>Only go outside for food, health reasons or work (but only if you cannot work from home)</li>
    <li>Stay 2 metres (6ft) away from other people</li>
    <li>Wash your hands as soon as you get home</li>
    </ul>
    Many young people experience few to no symptoms at all but can still carry the virus and pass 
    it on to those who are more vulnerable.
