            The data show's that, for this trust, on average 1743 fewer people 
            are waiting over four hours to be seen at A&E than in 2019.

            <p>
            Unfortunately, for many English hospitals, the situation is much worse.
            After nearly a decade of Conservative rule, each month over <b>400,000</b>
            more people are made to wait <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than in 2011.

             <p>Now, Brexit and an impending trade deal with Trump's US threatens to increase the NHS drug bill from &pound18 billion to as much as <b>&pound45 billion</b> a year while shutting out the nurses, carers and other workers that the health service depends on.</p>

            <p><i>Note: Over the past few months A&E attendance across England has fallen by more than 50% as people choose to stay at home to help reduce the pressure on the NHS 
            during the current pandemic.</i></p>

            <p>Unfortunatly, similar things are being seen accross the country.

            That's a decrease of 21%.</p>
            
            <p>Over 50% of NHS trusts have fewer beds,  whereas only around 10%
            of trusts have significantly more. See our <a href = "england.html"> summary page for the whole of England</a>.</p>
