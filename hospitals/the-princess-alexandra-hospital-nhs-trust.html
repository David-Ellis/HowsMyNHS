            <p>After nearly a decade of Conservative rule, on average, <b>1362</b> more people each month are being left to wait over 
            four hours at A&E at <b>your</b> hospital than back in 2010.</p>

            <center><img src="../figures/the-princess-alexandra-hospital-nhs-trust-waiting.svg" alt="A&E waiting data for The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust - Number of people waiting over four hours each month."></center>

            <p>And things are bad for the rest of England too. Each month over <b>400,000</b> more people are made to wait
            <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than in 2011.

            <p>Now, Brexit and an impending trade deal with the US threatens to increase the NHS drug bill from &pound18 billion to as much as <b>&pound45 billion</b> a year while shutting out the nurses, carers and other workers that the health service depends on.</p>

            <p><i>Note: Over the past few months A&E attendance across England has fallen by more than 50% as people choose to stay at home to help reduce the pressure on the NHS 
            during the current pandemic.</i></p>

            <p> For better or for worse, the number of beds owned by The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust hasn't changed much. Under Conservative leadership, the trust has 2 more beds than in 2010.<p>

            <p>Unfortunately, this isn't the case for many NHS trusts accross the country.
            Overall, there are 22930 fewer NHS beds in England than in 2010. 
            That's a decrease of over 18%.</p>
            
            <p>Over 46% of NHS trusts have fewer beds,  whereas only around 15%
            of trusts have significantly more. See our <a href = "england.html"> summary page for the whole of England</a>.</p>

        Unfortunately, since the start of the pandemic in March, there have been 500 reported deaths related to Covid-19 at in hospitals under this Trust. There were 0 deaths recorded yesterday and a total of 1 over the last seven days.
        </p>
    <p>
    So far, there have been a total of 86,400 Covid-19 related deaths in English hospitals. 
    2 of these were recorded yesterday and 100 over the last seven days. <span style="color:#999999;">Last updated: 3/4/2021</span>.
    <center><img src="../figures/the-princess-alexandra-hospital-nhs-trust-covid.svg" alt="Number of Covid-19 related deaths for The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust."></center>
    <p>Please note that these figures, particularly the most recent ones, are subject to change as new reports are made. Additionally, these figures do not include deaths outside hospital, such as those in care homes. For additional information, please see the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-daily-deaths/">official NHS page</a> for Covid-19 death statistics.
    </p>
    
<p>
Undoubtedly, Government failures have meant that more people have died from Covid-19 than they otherwise would have. From toying with the idea of 'herd immunity' instead of initiating an early lockdown to the failure to provide adequate PPE to frontline staff and an ineffective privately run track-and-trace system, the Governments response to the pandemic has been sadly inadequate.
</p>

<p>Additionally, after a decade of underfunding and neglect, the NHS was ill-prepared for a pandemic of this scale. With A&E waiting times at an all-time high, and the number of overnight beds at an all-time low. </p>

<p>The NHS deserves better, we deserve better and we must unite in demanding better.</p>
