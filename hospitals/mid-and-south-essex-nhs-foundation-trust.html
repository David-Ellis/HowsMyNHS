            <p>After nearly a decade of Conservative rule, on average, <b>292</b> more people are being left to wait over 
            four hours at A&E at <b>your</b> hospital than back in 2010.</p>

            <center><img src="../figures/mid-and-south-essex-nhs-foundation-trust-waiting.svg" alt="A&E waiting data for Mid And South Essex NHS Foundation Trust - Number of people waiting over four hours each month."></center>

            <p>And things are bad for the rest of England too. Each month over <b>400,000</b> more people are made to wait
            <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than in 2011.

            <p>Now, Brexit and an impending trade deal with Trump's US threatens to increase the NHS drug bill from &pound18 billion to as much as <b>&pound45 billion</b> a year while shutting out the nurses, carers and other workers that the health service depends on.</p>

            <p><i>Note: Over the past few months A&E attendance across England has fallen by more than 50% as people choose to stay at home to help reduce the pressure on the NHS 
            during the current pandemic.</i></p>

            <p> For better or for worse, the number of beds owned by Mid And South Essex NHS Foundation Trust hasn't changed much. Under Conservative leadership, the trust has 21 fewer beds than in 2010.<p>

            <p>Unfortunatly, this isn't the case for many NHS trusts accross the country.
            Overall, there are 26003 fewer NHS beds in England than in 2010. 
            That's a decrease of over 21%.</p>
            
            <p>Over 50% of NHS trusts have fewer beds,  whereas only around 10%
            of trusts have significantly more. See our <a href = "england.html"> summary page for the whole of England</a>.</p>
