            <p>Under Conservative leadership, South West London And St George's Mental Health NHS Trust has around 300 fewer beds than in 2010. That's a 44.1% drop in the number of beds for those who might desperately need them.<p>

            <p>Unfortunatly, similar things are being seen accross the country. 
            Overall, there are 26,000 fewer NHS beds in England than in 2010. 
            That's a decrease of over 20%. See our 
            <a href = "england.html"> summary page for the whole of England</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Over 48% of NHS trusts have fewer beds,  whereas little more than 10%
            of trusts have significantly more. See our <a href = "england.html"> summary page for the whole of England</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Now, Brexit and an impending trade deal with Trump's US threatens to increase the NHS drug bill from &pound18 billion to as much as <b>&pound45 billion</b> a year while shutting out the nurses, carers and other workers that the health service depends on.</p>

            <p><i>Note: Over the past few months A&E attendance across England has fallen by more than 50% as people choose to stay at home to help reduce the pressure on the NHS 
            during the current pandemic.</i></p>
