            <p>After nearly a decade of Conservative rule, on average, <b>315</b> more people are being left to wait over 
            four hours at A&E at <b>your</b> hospital than back in 2010.</p>
            <p>And things are bad for the rest of England too. Each month over <b>400,000</b> more people are made to wait
            <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than in 2011.
            <p>Now, Brexit and a trade deal with Trumps US threatens to increase the NHS drug bill from &pound18 billion to as much 
            as <b>&pound45 billion</b> a year while shutting out the nurses, carers and other workers that the health service depends on.</p>

    <p><b style="color:#005EB8;">Vote for your NHS:</b> Our NHS is in crisis. With waiting times at an all 
    time high, but this problem is not without blame. Tory cuts and general underfunding
    have left our hospitals understaffed and lacking in vital resources.</p>
    <p>Through tactical voting we can maximise the number of seats in parliament we can take from
    the conservative MPs. Find out who to vote for <a href="https://tactical.vote/">here</a>.</p>

    <p><b style="color:#005EB8;">Share the message:</b> Fight for change. Let your friends and family know that the Conservatives 
    are not the party for the NHS. One vote may have little impact, particularly with our broken electoral system. 
    But together we can bring about great change.</p>
