            <p> For better or for worse, the number of beds owned by Central And North West London NHS Foundation Trust hasn't changed much. Under Conservative leadership, the trust has 17 fewer beds than in 2010.<p>

            <p>Unfortunatly, this isn't the case for many NHS trusts accross the country. Overall, there are 26,000 fewer NHS beds in England than in 2010. That's a decrease of over 20%.</p>
            
            <p>Over 48% of NHS trusts have fewer beds,  whereas little more than 10%
            of trusts have significantly more. See our <a href = "england.html"> summary page for the whole of England</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Now, Brexit and an impending trade deal with Trump's US threatens to increase the NHS drug bill from &pound18 billion to as much as <b>&pound45 billion</b> a year while shutting out the nurses, carers and other workers that the health service depends on.</p>

            <p><i>Note: Over the past few months A&E attendance across England has fallen by more than 50% as people choose to stay at home to help reduce the pressure on the NHS 
            during the current pandemic.</i></p>
