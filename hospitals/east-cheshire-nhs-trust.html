            <p>After nearly a decade of Conservative rule, on average, <b>122</b> more people are being left to wait over 
            four hours at A&E at <b>your</b> hospital than back in 2010.</p>

            <center><img src="../figures/east-cheshire-nhs-trust-waiting.png" alt="A&E waiting data for East Cheshire NHS Trust - Number of people waiting over four hours each month."></center>

            <p>And things are bad for the rest of England too. Each month over <b>400,000</b> more people are made to wait
            <b>over four hours</b> to be seen at A&E than in 2011.

            <p>Now, Brexit and an impending trade deal with Trump's US threatens to increase the NHS drug bill from &pound18 billion to as much as <b>&pound45 billion</b> a year while shutting out the nurses, carers and other workers that the health service depends on.</p>

            <p><i>Note: Over the past few months A&E attendance across England has fallen by more than 50% as people choose to stay at home to help reduce the pressure on the NHS 
            during the current pandemic.</i></p>

            <p>Under Conservative leadership, East Cheshire NHS Trust has around 36 fewer beds than in 2010. That's a 9.6% drop in the number of beds for those who might desperately need them.<p>

            <p>Unfortunatly, similar things are being seen accross the country. 
            Overall, there are 26003 fewer NHS beds in England than in 2010. 
            That's a decrease of 21%.</p>
            
            <p>Over 50% of NHS trusts have fewer beds,  whereas only around 10%
            of trusts have significantly more. See our <a href = "england.html"> summary page for the whole of England</a>.</p>
